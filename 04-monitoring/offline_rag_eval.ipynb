There will often be a description of the error or instructions on what is needed or even how to fix it. I have even seen a link to the solution. Does it reference a specific line of your code?\\nRestart app or server/pc.\\nGoogle it, use ChatGPT, Bing AI etc.\\nIt is going to be rare that you are the first to have the problem, someone out there has posted the fly issue and likely the solution.\\nSearch using: <technology> <problem statement>. Example: pgcli error column c.relhasoids does not exist.\\nThere are often different solutions for the same problem due to variation in environments.\\nCheck the tech’s documentation. Use its search if available or use the browsers search function.\\nTry uninstall (this may remove the bad actor) and reinstall of application or reimplementation of action. Remember to restart the server/pc for reinstalls.\\nSometimes reinstalling fails to resolve the issue but works if you uninstall first.\\nPost your question to Stackoverflow. Read the Stackoverflow guide on posting good questions.\\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask\\nThis will be your real life. Ask an expert in the future (in addition to coworkers).\\nAsk in Slack\\nBefore asking a question,\\nCheck Pins (where the shortcut to the repo and this FAQ is located)\\nUse the slack app’s search function\\nUse the bot @ZoomcampQABot to do the search for you\\ncheck the FAQ (this document), use search [ctrl+f]\\nWhen asking a question, include as much information as possible:\\nWhat are you coding on?

Describe what has changed in the environment.\\nProvide additional information in the same thread of the steps you have taken for resolution.\\nTake a break and come back later. You will be amazed at how often you figure out the solution after letting your brain rest.

You can fix this error by:\\n\\n1. Running the Docker build command in a directory that only contains the required files, which are `Dockerfile` and `ingest_data.py`, as the issue might be related to unnecessary context being sent during the build.\\n\\n2. Changing the permissions of the directory (`ny_taxi_postgres_data`) to ensure that the current user has access. This can be achieved by using one of the following commands:\\n   - On Ubuntu/Linux:\\n     ```bash\\n     sudo chown -R $USER /home/user/repos/data-engineering/week_1_basics_n_setup/2_docker_sql/ny_taxi_postgres_data\\n     ```\\n     OR\\n     ```bash\\n     sudo chmod -R 777 /home/user/repos/data-engineering/week_1_basics_n_setup/2_docker_sql/ny_taxi_postgres_data\\n     ```\\n   \\n3.

Update the network name accordingly, such as replacing `pg-network` with something like `2docker_default`, and ensure the database name is correctly specified, for example, replacing `pgdatabase` with `2docker-pgdatabase-1`.\\n\\n2. **Verify Container Status:**\\n   - Run `docker ps -a` to see all stopped and running containers. This helps you ensure that the database container (e.g., pg-database) is running.\\n\\n3. **Modify Host Names:**\\n   - If a host name doesn’t resolve and results in an error, try using a different host name. Avoid using names with hyphens, which can sometimes cause issues.\\n\\n4. **Ensure Database is Running:**\\n   - Ensure that the PostgreSQL database is running by using `docker-compose up -d`.

Log out and log back in after making these changes.\\n\\n2. **Persisting pgAdmin Configuration**: To avoid reconfiguring your pgAdmin connection each time you start your containers, create a volume in your `docker-compose.yaml` file. Under the `pgAdmin` service, include the following:\\n   ```yaml\\n   volumes:\\n     - type: volume\\n       source: pgadmin_data\\n       target: /var/lib/pgadmin\\n   volumes:\\n     pgadmin_data:\\n   ```\\n   This setup maintains the state so pgAdmin remembers your previous connections.\\n\\n3. **Persistent Storage on GCP**: When using Docker Compose on GCP, data persistence might not work with a local path. Instead, use Docker Volumes:\\n   ```yaml\\n   services:\\n     pgadmin:\\n       ...\\n       volumes:\\n         pgadmin:/var/lib/pgadmin\\n   volumes:\\n     pgadmin:\\n   ```\\n\\n4. **Access Issues via Browser**: If you cannot access pgAdmin through your browser, modify your setup to ensure pgAdmin listens on all addresses and the correct port:\\n   ```yaml\\n   pgadmin:\\n     image: dpage/pgadmin4\\n     environment:\\n       - PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL=admin@admin.com\\n       - PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=pgadmin\\n       - PGADMIN_CONFIG_WTF_CSRF_ENABLED=False\\n       - PGADMIN_LISTEN_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0\\n       - PGADMIN_LISTEN_PORT=5050\\n     ports:\\n       - \"5050:5050\"\\n   ```\\n\\nFollowing these adjusted configurations should help mitigate common issues with setting up Docker Compose and pgAdmin.',\n",

If the create server dialog does not appear, it\\'s likely due to a new version of pgAdmin. Try using \"register -> server\" instead.\\n\\n2. If you encounter a blank or white screen after logging into pgAdmin in a browser using GitHub Codespaces, you can:\\n   - Set the environment variable `PGADMIN_CONFIG_WTF_CSRF_ENABLED=\"False\"` in your Docker run command.\\n   - Alternatively, access GitHub Codespaces using the locally installed VSCode to avoid this issue.\\n\\n3. If pgAdmin is not working for querying in PostgreSQL, especially when running on Git Bash or a VM in Windows, libraries like psycopg2 and libpq might still cause errors. Consider using `psql` instead of pgAdmin.\\n\\n4. If you cannot access or open the pgAdmin address via a browser, especially if connecting remotely via SSH or with specific docker configurations:\\n   - Ensure your Docker run command includes setting `PGADMIN_LISTEN_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0` and map the appropriate ports.\\n   - Modify your `docker-compose.yaml` file to include these settings and ensure `PGADMIN_CONFIG_WTF_CSRF_ENABLED=False`.\\n\\nThese solutions should help resolve common issues with running pgAdmin in various environments.',\n",
